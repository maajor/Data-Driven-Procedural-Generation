Data Driven Procedural Generation

-----

This repository presents some frontier researches using data driven methods, e.g. machine learning, for procedural content generation purpose.
Although contradictory that "procedural" means rule-based. In traditional procedural domains, tech-artists create rules to generate assets. However, definition of machine learning is to learn rule from data. So the role of tech-artists evolves from creating rules to supervising and guiding computer to understand rules.
